Aidin aims to stop this practice, and instead create choice based on the quality of service and care, generating business for &nbsp;high-quality providers and moving patients away from low performers. &nbsp;The website that gives detailed information on different nursing homes and other post-acute care providers to patients who are in the process of choosing between a multitude of options.</p>
          <p class="expand-use-case-para">Aidin presents patients with a 1-page profile for every PAC that offers admission. These profiles are created by combining the diagnosis and demographics of a patient with open datasets such as “Nursing Home Compare,” from the Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. Additional information on the profile is formed from Aidin’s own tracking of readmission rates for PACs, patient reviews, and photos of each PAC.</p>
          <p class="expand-use-case-para">Out of the patients presented with Aidin’s profiles of providers in their area, 80% will choose a high-performing PAC. By reducing the amount of asymmetric information between patients and providers, Aidin is making an impact on readmission rates to PACs, as well as directing PAC focus to quality of care instead of advertisements and airtime.</p>

Expert Grup produces reports on economic, environmental, and energy forecasts in Moldova. They have made several projects on these topics, focusing on ways to visualize large datasets and information taken from Moldova’s open data portal. The website’s &nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.budgetstories.md/anul-bugetar-2015/">Budget Calendar</a> and OpenSpending <a target="_blank" href="http://www.budgetstories.md/bugetul-2014/">budget treemap </a>projects both visualize this data in visual ways more accessible to an average citizen. They also provide the data in an <a href="http://www.budgetstories.md/bugetul-scolii-2014/" target="_blank">online data portal.</a>
          </p>
          <p class="expand-use-case-para">The Budget Calendar project is a grid including the time of the year on the y axis and the steps towards approving a budget on the x axis. Within each cell, Expert Grup links the user to government reports relevant to that specific piece of the budget process, streamlining what could be a tedious search through multiple government sites to find this information. Expert Grup’s OpenSpending budget treemap also uses this open data, compiling it into a colorful visualization that gives the viewer a comparative understanding on where Moldova fits in comparison to other countries’ parliaments.</p>

For example, in its website, which also serves as an advocacy platform, the EAZ has contributed to the dissemination of the results of 2015 Living Conditions Monitoring Survey, a poverty assessment <a href="http://eaz.org.zm/2015-living-conditions-monitoring-survey-results/" target="_blank">study </a>conducted by the Central statistical office to monitor and highlight the living conditions of the population of Zambia.

The Government of Mexico worked jointly with ENOVA to achieve digital inclusivity in establishing a “Network of Innovation and Learning” (Las redes de innovación y aprendizaje - RIA) centers. ENOVA utilized open data to determine areas of greatest need and most potential impact.</p>
          <p class="expand-use-case-para">Through a method characterized as <a target="_blank" href="http://enova.mx/en/node/297">“urban acupuncture”</a>, several indicators taken from publicly accessible databases were examined, including population density, income, level of education, public schools, commercial areas, public transportation systems, green areas, and access to roads. With 70 centers across 34 municipalities in the State of Mexico, government data was maximized to assess local needs within educational capacity building. Since each institution has specific needs, Enova focuses on the importance of adaptability in addition to the accessibility of their products.</p>

          <p class="expand-use-case-para"><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;In an ever-expanding market of consumer products and goods whose origins are often completely unknown to the buyer, information on where and under what conditions was a product made is hard to come by. GoodGuide works to provide consumers with this kind of information through its searchable consumer product database, ranking products such as candy, coffee and tea, food, and household chemicals, by their health, environment, and social performances.</p>
          <p class="expand-use-case-para">GoodGuide draws its information from a wide variety of sources, from scientific institutions to NGOs to open government data sources. Its algorithm takes these datasets and ranks products correspondingly. For example, if a user were to look up Teas, they would find Frontier’s and Twinings’ Green Teas, as well as 4,831 other tea products, all ranked with an aggregate GoodGuide score as well as company, environment, and social scores. These scores are associated with indicators such as the amount of recycled content in their packaging for their environmental score, or whether a product is certified fair trade for its social score.</p>
          <p class="expand-use-case-para">GoodGuide improves the ability for consumers to not only learn what they are buying in terms of work conditions and company environmental and social efforts, but also to gain a level of collective purchasing power based on increased information symmetry.</p>

Green Patrol leads investigations using citizen-based self-reporting systems, regional data from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, regional open data portals, and Green Patrol investigations. Through a <a href="http://greenpatrol.ru/sites/default/files/broshyura_english_prezent.pdf" target="_blank">network of 53 branches </a>throughout Russia, they collect data and integrate findings on environmental governance issues onto the online database. Green Patrol has investigations completed on 85 regions in Russia.</p>
          <p class="expand-use-case-para">To support these investigations, Green Patrol uses geographic information system (GIS) to create accurate environmental rankings of the entities within Russia. These rankings rely on indicators such as water, land resources, bioresources and more, along with environmental indexes. In order to use this data, Green Patrol seeks information from regional data portals and Russian Ministries; they include mortality data, environmental protection expenditures, and air polluters and surface water bodies. Through these mediums, Green Patrol created for the Sakha Republic, for example, a <a target="_blank" href="http://greenpatrol.ru/sites/default/files/doklad_o_sostoyanii_i_ohrane_okruzhayushchey_sredy_respubliki_saha_2014_god.pdf">2014 regional report</a> and <a href="http://greenpatrol.ru/ru/regiony/respublika-saha-yakutiya" target="_blank">up-to-date assessments</a> to evaluate environmental policy violations.

          <p class="expand-use-case-para">Haezoom is one of many companies that have sprung up from the South Korean government’s 2013 <a href="http://www.law.go.kr/LSW/lsInfoP.do?lsiSeq=142444#0000" target="_blank">public data act,</a> and Haezoom itself relies on building, geographical, solar radiation, air temperature, as well as a number of other datasets provided by several Ministries in the government, the National Academy of Sciences, and the Korea Meteorological Administration. It analyzes these datasets alongside the user’s monthly electrical bill to predict expected energy savings, installation costs, and CO2 emission reductions. The service then suggests which solar energy installation best suits the user’s needs.</p>
          <p class="expand-use-case-para">Haezoom fills two essential, yet previously vacant, roles within the South Korean solar industry. First, it provides an impartial cost-benefit analysis of solar panel installation to clients. Second, it suggests credible manufacturers to purchase solar panels from based on its user’s needs. In doing so, Haezoom promotes the adoption of solar energy by increasing the amount of information available to customers.</p>

Accordingly, information on a vehicle’s history is therefore seen as an essential help for shoppers to make better purchase decisions when buying cars. InstaVIN addresses this by providing a vehicle history reporting service that looks up information on a Vehicle identification number (VIN) instantly when it is submitted by a consumer, and then sends the information back to the consumer.</p>
          <p class="expand-use-case-para">The service runs an immediate background check on the vehicle, grabbing information from state and federal government sources, like the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System, police reports, as well as from private sources like car dealers and insurance records. This information, which may include theft, towing, impound, lien data, vehicle specifications, is then sent right back to the consumer. Taking advantage of this combination of data sources, consumers can get the title and salvage history of a vehicle thus reducing the risk of making a costly decision when purchasing it.</p>

          <p class="expand-use-case-para"><strong>Impact:</strong> Investigative journalism and making government information accessible in an open format</p>
          <p class="expand-use-case-para"><strong>Data Used:</strong>&nbsp;Many including macroeconomic data, consumer indices, monthly industrial data, weather data, CO2 emissions, consumer complaints, tourism statistics, transportation data, political contributions in Argentina, and Buenos Aires census data</p>
          <p class="expand-use-case-para"><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;La Nacion newspaper has been engaged in using and disseminating open data in various ways. In 2010, the newspaper started a project on data visualization where journalists, graphic designers and computer scientists worked together to understand how visualization tools can be used for reporting. The first delivery of this initiative, a <a href="http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1380725-colectivos-insaciables-un-cheque-diario-de-10-millones-en-subsidios" target="_blank">report </a>on Argentina’s Subsidies System for Transportation, relied on combining open transportation data from two government agencies ( Secretary of Transportation, and National Commission for Transport Regulation). The investigation discovered that the subsidies (gas and cash) grew dramatically (up to $34 billion) during the past ten years, and revealed the 20 companies that received more money from this system.</p>
          <p class="expand-use-case-para">However, getting the public data in the first place poses a significant challenge. Since Argentina doesn’t have a law that allows citizens access public documents, like Freedom of Information Act in the U.S, all the information used in this investigation had to be converted from PDF’s documents to CSV and Excel files. In this context, making public data available in an open format is another goal of La Nacion. In march 2012, the newspaper launched an <a target="_blank" href="http://data.lanacion.com.ar/dashboards/4608/actividad-legislativa/">open data portal</a>. In this portal, users can access official data in the domains of legislation and policy-making, general indicators, environment, sports, and economics.</p>

The Lebanese Elections Data Analysis project features visualizations such as voter trends based on gender, voter representation in the Parliament, and citizen involvement in the political system.</p>
          <p class="expand-use-case-para">These visualizations are based on data collected by the LADE as well as from government data published by the Ministry of the Interior and Municipalities (MoIM), the Directorate General of Personal Services (DGPS), and the www.elections.gov.lb website. Additionally, during the election, LADE is prepared to monitor electoral violations and map them on its website. It will also create maps similar to those on its website in order to delineate voting patterns and proportionality of the election. LADE’s project will help ensure transparency in the upcoming general elections and provide vital information informing citizens and legislators on how to move forward with legislative and electoral reforms.</p>

Under the services of <a href="http://farmobi-technologies-pvt-ltd.android.informer.com/" target="_blank">Farmobi Technologies Pvt Ltd,</a> Mandi Trades allows buyers and sellers to bypass the middlemen often involved in the Indian food industry. Instead, this platform creates an environment where buyers can purchase crops directly from local farmers, which reduces transportation costs and increases profit margins for both parties. These services also automatically incorporate the locations of sellers upon uploading datasets.</p>
          <p class="expand-use-case-para">The Farmobi Technologies' app levels the agricultural market in two ways. First, it features agricultural market price data from the government of India’s data portal, <a target="_blank" href="https://data.gov.in/">data.gov.in</a>, to make public information access a key component to competitive pricing. Second, the app lets farmers directly post details about their crops, making purchasing decisions transparent to both suppliers and buyers. These two features in Mandi Trades not only decreases information asymmetry but also leverages existing government data to encourage public data use within the agriculture sector for fair and competitive pricing.</p>

          <p class="expand-use-case-para"><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;Ghana’s legislature is composed of 275 Members of Parliament (MPs) that are elected to serve their single-member constituencies. However, while the majority of the activities in parliament, such as votings, motions, and committees, take place in the open, too often, information is difficult to find, access and use. Created in 2012, Odekro is an online platform that aims to promote transparency and citizen participation in Ghana by providing public access to Bills, Motions, and Parliamentary proceedings (Hansards).</p>
          <p class="expand-use-case-para">Mainly, the work of Odekro is to extract the data from different public sources, such as the Parliament of Ghana, the Electoral commission, and Ghana statistical service. While some of the data is available in excel formats, often Odekro has to convert data from paper or PDF to a machine-readable format. Making this information open allows media organizations to contribute to a more evidence-based public discussion, and increased public accountability of Members of Parliament. An example of this was the attention recently drawn to the country’s non-attending MPs after a <a href="https://www.modernghana.com/news/660880/1/125-mps-risk-losing-seats-for-absenteeism.html" target="_blank">letter sent by Odekro to the Speaker of Parliament based on this data</a>. The Odekro platform also provides tools that allow users to discuss online while discussions are taking place in the Parliament, as well as to report issues affecting their constituencies, or follow the specific issues the MPs for their constituencies are contributing to. In this way, Odekro aims to enable communities and marginalized populations to leverage this information to engage with government agencies.</p>

          <p class="expand-use-case-para"><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;In light of the thriving real estate market in Hungary, the company Mapsolutions Zrt. developed the website Otthonterkep in 2013 with the goal of providing home buyers an interactive home search interface. Via its real estate property search portal, Otthonterkep provides users with information on Hungarian real estate, including average house prices, parking prices , green spaces or even a criminal and demographic information. The website also includes a map that gives an overview of the housing market in Hungary. Otthonterkep constructed this map using data provided by public sources, including housing market transactions, census data, and national crime statistics.</p>
          <p class="expand-use-case-para">Since 1990, Budapest underwent a construction boom, which was fuelled not only by local demand but also by the rising interest of international investors in the real estate. Additional <a href="http://dailynewshungary.com/map-shows-the-age-of-the-hungarian-real-estates/" target="_blank">analysis </a>of Otthonterkep‘s &nbsp;map conducted by index.hu offers valuable insights into the Hungarian housing stock, such as the aging of the buildings, the decline in new building permits issued in recent years, and the variation in price per square meter. The analysis also concludes that, in Hungary, there is a strong correlation of price per square meter and the age of the building, in particular for those that were built after 1990.</p>

          <p class="expand-use-case-para"><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;The idea for Päästöt.fi came about when its creator ran into a roadblock while looking into greenhouse gas emissions statistics of a local energy company. In order to circumvent this issue, he came across the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) database, which was established in July 2000 to collect the annual emissions numbers from industrial facilities across Europe. Päästöt.fi emerged was created in 2010 to allow users to compare emission levels from industrial facilities across Europe.</p>
          <p class="expand-use-case-para">Päästöt.fi visualizes some 30,000 industrial facilities, from mining sites to coal-fired plants. These facilities are all mapped on the platform, and information such as CO2, heavy metal, or another 89 other kinds of industrial emissions are overlaid on this map; the magnitude of each site’s emissions is shown through circles of varying sizes, and a box to the right relates the numerical figures associated with the selected site.</p>
          <p class="expand-use-case-para">Päästöt.fi manages to effectively communicate important information that was previously stored within a huge dataset that a layperson would otherwise not engage with. Through its visualization, citizens are now able to gain the necessary information to lobby and create change.</p>

In the realm of evolving intellectual property rights and the continual stream of new innovations, individuals and companies face the challenge of tracking legal developments. This platform facilitates easy information access by consolidating information from government patent websites. Databases and their contents are openly accessible and downloadable from this platform, including United States and European patents and applications, Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) documents, and Japanese abstracts.</p>
          <p class="expand-use-case-para">An open platform for data storage and accessible usage such as SumoBrain expedites the patent search process for lawyers, investors, and researchers. While maintaining transparency, these efforts encourage greater competition and access to industry trends through government-based mechanisms, taking what already exists and interpreting the data for public use. Ultimately, the opportunity to build products off of open data lowers barriers for many entering or participating in an industry. For example, by placing government publications into one database, SumoBrain provides users around the world have immediate access to patent documents and references, all of which presented in a consistent and searchable format. Users maintain virtual tools to manage work files through annotations, exports to Excel, and editing access for colleagues.</p>

In the last few years, Telefónica has been an active promoter of open data use, both internally and externally. In its own operations, Telefónica makes use of open economic data, as well as demographic data, to identify customer segments and adjust product offerings in accordance with economic forecast. The organization also leverages satellite and population data to inform decisions on where to build telecommunications infrastructure.</p>
          <p class="expand-use-case-para">Telefónica engages a broad stakeholder network as well around open data use. For example, in 2013, in partnership with the Open Data Institute and the MIT Medialab, Telefónica hosted a <a target="_blank" href="http://dynamicinsights.telefonica.com/2013/08/29/using-big-data-for-social-good/">“hackathon for big data”</a> which promoted the integration of open transportation and health data with other proprietary data sets. to create value for social good. During the event, teams were encouraged to study how crowds move towards high streets during the busy Christmas shopping period in order to develop strategies for the emergency services to allocate their resources more effectively, or make recommendations of how to manage the flow of road traffic on London’s busiest routes. In its home country, Telefónica has also promoted the use of open data by hosting workshops on <a href="https://en.fundaciontelefonica.com/blog/conferencias/data-journalism-and-open-data/" target="_blank">“Data Journalism and Open Data”</a> to &nbsp;encourage Spanish journalists, programmers and other professionals to create content using open data.</p>

          <p class="expand-use-case-para"><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;Despite the increasing amount of data available online, it can be difficult for investors to access relevant information. Founded in 2013, Thinknum’s provides data access and insights to its users through its web platform. The organization aggregates and indexes data from government sources, companies’ websites and social media activity.</p>
          <p class="expand-use-case-para">For example, Thinknum allows users to view the store locations of a given brand, overlay it with locations of a competitor, and then connect this information to demographic data such as median household income by county. This information can then be used to inform an organization’s strategy of where household income is increasing, and thereby identify the most profitable store locations. Other examples include the analysis of unemployment rates to discover outperforming businesses in the restaurant industry, and taking advantage of historical weather data to find market patterns. By creating connections between different data sources, Thinknum allows investors and companies to better understand the various factors that drive valuation.</p>

          <p class="expand-use-case-para"><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;Founded in 2009, Twaweza is a civil society organization that helps citizens exercise agency and governments be more open and responsive in Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda. Twaweza works to provide practical information to everyone, to foster quality independent media and citizen monitoring services. Via its Uwazi unit, Twaweza produces policy briefs on key issues, thus triggering public debate and fostering an ecosystem of change. In this context, Twaweza is an active promoter of open data, encouraging both the supply and use of public data.</p>
          <p class="expand-use-case-para">In its own use, Twaweza draws on public data to conduct research across the fields of open government and basic education. For example, in the Tanzanian general elections in 2015, Twaweza organised televised debates between leading politicians from different parties, and used data from a range of different sources as a means of stimulating discussion, and of trying to guide the debate towards a greater focus on evidence. In part, the data that was used was sourced internally - from the Uwezo survey of basic learning outcomes and the Sautiza Wananchi mobile phone panel survey - but the remaining data, which included economic data, census and other household survey data, official data on public services (school enrolment rates, etc.) budget data and more, was pulled from official government sources. While some of the data was available in machine-readable formats, much had to be converted from pdfs and reports.</p>

As a founding member of the Australian Business Roundtable for Disaster Resilience &amp; Safer Communities, IAG works to create a national approach toward investing in disaster mitigation efforts through big data applications. IAG relies on government statistics to price and issue policies, process claims, create predictive modeling, and pursue risk management. These data sources include the Geoscience Australia, the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Bureau of Meteorology for Cyclone Track Maps, and the New South Wales Rural Fire Service RSS Feed.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">Subsequently, IAG was tasked by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) to lead the second phase, <a href="http://globalriskmap.nicta.com.au/About.html" target="_blank">Global Risk Map</a>, of the Principles of Sustainable Insurance (PSI) Global Resilient Project, looking at risk reduction in natural disasters. This project’s virtual tools track national-level vulnerability to natural hazards, national-level resilience, the economic and social impacts, exposure to natural hazards, and country-level natural hazard events. Under the approval of the UNEP, data sources are EM-DAT database, INFORM, World Bank Database, PreventionWeb. Along the data catalogue, users may narrow down disaster types and download feature information in CSV formatting.</p>

Their Public Good program endeavors to empower individuals in making data-driven decision-making in business and policy-making. NZIER focuses on data management and provides the tools for different data interpretation. To strengthen existing government data, NZIER incorporates information from The Treasury, New Zealand’s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/snapshots-of-nz/digital-yearbook-collection.aspx">Official Yearbooks (1893-2012)</a> from Statistics New Zealand, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oecd.org/gov/government-at-a-glance-2015-database.htm">Government at a Glance database</a> from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">These sources then develop their database called <a target="_blank" href="https://data1850.nz/">Data1850, </a>which bridges data from five sectors: government, economic activity, prices, international linkages, and people. With the lack of statistics data available prior to 1850, the platform was coined Data1850. Their services include datasets or other information on economic or statistics based history, spanning from 1850 to present day. Easily operable and downloadable, the data is available for free on the website. Users choose among economic activity, people, and prices to begin, and then narrow down data options. For example, employment may be first narrowed down by industry or by occupation, then the types of services or professions.</p>

            <p class="expand-use-case-para">Cultural Routes, one of several apps built by BNet, a Russian app developer company, takes all of its data from the Russian government’s open data portal. Currently, the application uses bicycle parking, museum, and city taxi parking datasets from data.mos.ru, and overlays this information onto a map. In addition to Cultural Routes’ original route function, BNet has added three other route recommendation functions: the first shows popular routes, the second takes the user’s location and finds nearby museums, the third lists museums most recommended by Cultural Routes users.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">By mapping existing museum, bike, and taxi information from Russia’s government data portal, the app reduces the time spent for tourists and museum-goes looking through multiple websites and planning their day along bikeshare apps, google maps, and taxi services.</p>

Green Patrol leads investigations using citizen-based self-reporting systems, regional data from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, regional open data portals, and Green Patrol investigations. Through a <a href="http://greenpatrol.ru/sites/default/files/broshyura_english_prezent.pdf" target="_blank">network of 53 branches </a>throughout Russia, they collect data and integrate findings on environmental governance issues onto the online database. Green Patrol has investigations completed on 85 regions in Russia.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">To support these investigations, Green Patrol uses geographic information system (GIS) to create accurate environmental rankings of the entities within Russia. These rankings rely on indicators such as water, land resources, bioresources and more, along with environmental indexes. In order to use this data, Green Patrol seeks information from regional data portals and Russian Ministries; they include mortality data, environmental protection expenditures, and air polluters and surface water bodies. Through these mediums, Green Patrol created for the Sakha Republic, for example, a <a target="_blank" href="http://greenpatrol.ru/sites/default/files/doklad_o_sostoyanii_i_ohrane_okruzhayushchey_sredy_respubliki_saha_2014_god.pdf">2014 regional report</a> and <a href="http://greenpatrol.ru/ru/regiony/respublika-saha-yakutiya" target="_blank">up-to-date assessments</a> to evaluate environmental policy violations. Subsequently, the Sakha Republic was marked in 73rd place of 85.</p>

            <p class="expand-use-case-para"><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;In light of the thriving real estate market in Hungary, the company Mapsolutions Zrt. developed the website Otthonterkep in 2013 with the goal of providing home buyers an interactive home search interface. Via its real estate property search portal, Otthonterkep provides users with information on Hungarian real estate, including average house prices, parking prices , green spaces or even a criminal and demographic information. The website also includes a map that gives an overview of the housing market in Hungary. Otthonterkep constructed this map using data provided by public sources, including housing market transactions, census data, and national crime statistics.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">Since 1990, Budapest underwent a construction boom, which was fuelled not only by local demand but also by the rising interest of international investors in the real estate. Additional <a href="http://dailynewshungary.com/map-shows-the-age-of-the-hungarian-real-estates/" target="_blank">analysis </a>of Otthonterkep‘s &nbsp;map conducted by index.hu offers valuable insights into the Hungarian housing stock, such as the aging of the buildings, the decline in new building permits issued in recent years, and the variation in price per square meter. The analysis also concludes that, in Hungary, there is a strong correlation of price per square meter and the age of the building, in particular for those that were built after 1990.</p>

            <p class="expand-use-case-para"><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;The idea for Päästöt.fi came about when its creator ran into a roadblock while looking into greenhouse gas emissions statistics of a local energy company. In order to circumvent this issue, he came across the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) database, which was established in July 2000 to collect the annual emissions numbers from industrial facilities across Europe. Päästöt.fi emerged was created in 2010 to allow users to compare emission levels from industrial facilities across Europe.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">Päästöt.fi visualizes some 30,000 industrial facilities, from mining sites to coal-fired plants. These facilities are all mapped on the platform, and information such as CO2, heavy metal, or another 89 other kinds of industrial emissions are overlaid on this map; the magnitude of each site’s emissions is shown through circles of varying sizes, and a box to the right relates the numerical figures associated with the selected site.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">Päästöt.fi manages to effectively communicate important information that was previously stored within a huge dataset that a layperson would otherwise not engage with. Through its visualization, citizens are now able to gain the necessary information to lobby and create change.</p>

In the realm of evolving intellectual property rights and the continual stream of new innovations, individuals and companies face the challenge of tracking legal developments. This platform facilitates easy information access by consolidating information from government patent websites. Databases and their contents are openly accessible and downloadable from this platform, including United States and European patents and applications, Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) documents, and Japanese abstracts.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">An open platform for data storage and accessible usage such as SumoBrain expedites the patent search process for lawyers, investors, and researchers. While maintaining transparency, these efforts encourage greater competition and access to industry trends through government-based mechanisms, taking what already exists and interpreting the data for public use. Ultimately, the opportunity to build products off of open data lowers barriers for many entering or participating in an industry. For example, by placing government publications into one database, SumoBrain provides users around the world have immediate access to patent documents and references, all of which presented in a consistent and searchable format. Users maintain virtual tools to manage work files through annotations, exports to Excel, and editing access for colleagues.</p>

In the last few years, Telefónica has been an active promoter of open data use, both internally and externally. In its own operations, Telefónica makes use of open economic data, as well as demographic data, to identify customer segments and adjust product offerings in accordance with economic forecast. The organization also leverages satellite and population data to inform decisions on where to build telecommunications infrastructure.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">Telefónica engages a broad stakeholder network as well around open data use. For example, in 2013, in partnership with the Open Data Institute and the MIT Medialab, Telefónica hosted a <a target="_blank" href="http://dynamicinsights.telefonica.com/2013/08/29/using-big-data-for-social-good/">“hackathon for big data”</a> which promoted the integration of open transportation and health data with other proprietary data sets. to create value for social good. During the event, teams were encouraged to study how crowds move towards high streets during the busy Christmas shopping period in order to develop strategies for the emergency services to allocate their resources more effectively, or make recommendations of how to manage the flow of road traffic on London’s busiest routes. In its home country, Telefónica has also promoted the use of open data by hosting workshops on <a href="https://en.fundaciontelefonica.com/blog/conferencias/data-journalism-and-open-data/" target="_blank">“Data Journalism and Open Data”</a> to &nbsp;encourage Spanish journalists, programmers and other professionals to create content using open data.</p>

            <p class="expand-use-case-para"><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;Enova, a social entrepreneurship company based in Mexico City, seeks to bridge the digital divide amongst both students as well as educators. In a population where <a target="_blank" href="http://www.state.gov/p/wha/rt/soa/2015/stories/239823.htm">69% lack access to computers or the Internet,</a> such communities have a wide array of educational and technological needs. The Government of Mexico worked jointly with ENOVA to achieve digital inclusivity in establishing a “Network of Innovation and Learning” (Las redes de innovación y aprendizaje - RIA) centers. ENOVA utilized open data to determine areas of greatest need and most potential impact.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">Through a method characterized as <a target="_blank" href="http://enova.mx/en/node/297">“urban acupuncture”</a>, several indicators taken from publicly accessible databases were examined, including population density, income, level of education, public schools, commercial areas, public transportation systems, green areas, and access to roads. With 70 centers across 34 municipalities in the State of Mexico, government data was maximized to assess local needs within educational capacity building. Since each institution has specific needs, Enova focuses on the importance of adaptability in addition to the accessibility of their products.</p>

            <p class="expand-use-case-para"><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;La Nacion newspaper has been engaged in using and disseminating open data in various ways. In 2010, the newspaper started a project on data visualization where journalists, graphic designers and computer scientists worked together to understand how visualization tools can be used for reporting. The first delivery of this initiative, a <a href="http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1380725-colectivos-insaciables-un-cheque-diario-de-10-millones-en-subsidios" target="_blank">report </a>on Argentina’s Subsidies System for Transportation, relied on combining open transportation data from two government agencies ( Secretary of Transportation, and National Commission for Transport Regulation). The investigation discovered that the subsidies (gas and cash) grew dramatically (up to $34 billion) during the past ten years, and revealed the 20 companies that received more money from this system.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">However, getting the public data in the first place poses a significant challenge. Since Argentina doesn’t have a law that allows citizens access public documents, like Freedom of Information Act in the U.S, all the information used in this investigation had to be converted from PDF’s documents to CSV and Excel files. In this context, making public data available in an open format is another goal of La Nacion. In march 2012, the newspaper launched an <a target="_blank" href="http://data.lanacion.com.ar/dashboards/4608/actividad-legislativa/">open data portal</a>. In this portal, users can access official data in the domains of legislation and policy-making, general indicators, environment, sports, and economics.</p>

Aidin aims to stop this practice, and instead create choice based on the quality of service and care, generating business for &nbsp;high-quality providers and moving patients away from low performers. &nbsp;The website that gives detailed information on different nursing homes and other post-acute care providers to patients who are in the process of choosing between a multitude of options.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">Aidin presents patients with a 1-page profile for every PAC that offers admission. These profiles are created by combining the diagnosis and demographics of a patient with open datasets such as “Nursing Home Compare,” from the Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. Additional information on the profile is formed from Aidin’s own tracking of readmission rates for PACs, patient reviews, and photos of each PAC.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">Out of the patients presented with Aidin’s profiles of providers in their area, 80% will choose a high-performing PAC. By reducing the amount of asymmetric information between patients and providers, Aidin is making an impact on readmission rates to PACs, as well as directing PAC focus to quality of care instead of advertisements and airtime.</p>

            <p class="expand-use-case-para"><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;In an ever-expanding market of consumer products and goods whose origins are often completely unknown to the buyer, information on where and under what conditions was a product made is hard to come by.

            <p class="expand-use-case-para">GoodGuide draws its information from a wide variety of sources, from scientific institutions to NGOs to open government data sources. Its algorithm takes these datasets and ranks products correspondingly. For example, if a user were to look up Teas, they would find Frontier’s and Twinings’ Green Teas, as well as 4,831 other tea products, all ranked with an aggregate GoodGuide score as well as company, environment, and social scores. These scores are associated with indicators such as the amount of recycled content in their packaging for their environmental score, or whether a product is certified fair trade for its social score.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">GoodGuide improves the ability for consumers to not only learn what they are buying in terms of work conditions and company environmental and social efforts, but also to gain a level of collective purchasing power based on increased information symmetry.</p>

Accordingly, information on a vehicle’s history is therefore seen as an essential help for shoppers to make better purchase decisions when buying cars. InstaVIN addresses this by providing a vehicle history reporting service that looks up information on a Vehicle identification number (VIN) instantly when it is submitted by a consumer, and then sends the information back to the consumer.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">The service runs an immediate background check on the vehicle, grabbing information from state and federal government sources, like the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System, police reports, as well as from private sources like car dealers and insurance records. This information, which may include theft, towing, impound, lien data, vehicle specifications, is then sent right back to the consumer. Taking advantage of this combination of data sources, consumers can get the title and salvage history of a vehicle thus reducing the risk of making a costly decision when purchasing it.</p>

            <p class="expand-use-case-para">As a promoter of open governance and open data, the CGPA has produced several studies on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.c-gpa.org/images/publications/FATA_BA_Report.pdf">education budgeting</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.c-gpa.org/images/publications/budget_analysis_town_iii_peshawar_district.pdf">municipal budgeting</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.c-gpa.org/images/publications/social_audit_water_senitation.pdf">others </a>which have contributed with analyses on areas such as public education <a target="_blank" href="http://www.c-gpa.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=129:improving-primary-education-governance-in-khyber-pukhtunkhwa&amp;catid=27&amp;Itemid=221">governance</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.c-gpa.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=127:improving-public-education-service-delivery-in-kp-and-fata&amp;catid=27&amp;Itemid=221">service deliver</a>y, the <a href="http://www.c-gpa.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=126:social-audit-of-water-and-sanitation-schemes-in-mardan-district-of-khyber-pakhtunkhwa-province-pakistan&amp;catid=27&amp;Itemid=221" target="_blank">right to drinking safe &nbsp;water and sanitation</a>, and public accountability at the local level. . The CGPA is also dedicated to making public data, such as data from the School Census, available in machine-readable format for everyone to access and use.

Under the services of <a href="http://farmobi-technologies-pvt-ltd.android.informer.com/" target="_blank">Farmobi Technologies Pvt Ltd,</a> Mandi Trades allows buyers and sellers to bypass the middlemen often involved in the Indian food industry. Instead, this platform creates an environment where buyers can purchase crops directly from local farmers, which reduces transportation costs and increases profit margins for both parties. These services also automatically incorporate the locations of sellers upon uploading datasets.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">The Farmobi Technologies' app levels the agricultural market in two ways. First, it features agricultural market price data from the government of India’s data portal, <a target="_blank" href="https://data.gov.in/">data.gov.in</a>, to make public information access a key component to competitive pricing. Second, the app lets farmers directly post details about their crops, making purchasing decisions transparent to both suppliers and buyers. These two features in Mandi Trades not only decreases information asymmetry but also leverages existing government data to encourage public data use within the agriculture sector for fair and competitive pricing.</p>

            <p class="expand-use-case-para"><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;Founded in 1974, The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) focuses on technological innovations related to sustainable development. The organization provides research and analysis on areas such as clean energy, water management, pollution management, sustainable agriculture, and climate resilience. In light of its expertise in sustainability-related issues, TERI has helped the government of India deliver timely and sustainable environmental policy and practice outcomes.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">At the core of its research endeavors, TERI relies on open data that relates mainly to the environment, but also data on demographics, as well as geospatial and satellite data such as forestry maps, agriculture maps, land use maps. Scientific publications published by TERI’s researchers comprise, for example, studies that make use of climate data to analyse the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.teriin.org/index.php?option=com_publication&amp;task=details&amp;sid=1112&amp;q=open%20data&amp;Itemid=151">importance and status of open climate data</a>, or to determine <a target="_blank" href="http://www.teriin.org/index.php?option=com_publication&amp;task=details&amp;sid=1523&amp;q=open%20data&amp;Itemid=151">variability of rainfall</a>, a parameter that is correlated with physical, social and economic changes. The use of LANDSAT TM satellite data, provided by the United States Geological Survey, has also been crucial for various studies investigating topics such as the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.teriin.org/index.php?option=com_publication&amp;task=details&amp;sid=1718&amp;q=open%20data&amp;Itemid=151">land surface</a>, or <a href="http://www.teriin.org/index.php?option=com_publication&amp;task=details&amp;sid=1747&amp;q=public%20data&amp;Itemid=151" target="_blank">forests </a>in India.</p>

Since the 1960s, the Economics Association of Zambia (EAZ), a non-partisan body established in the 1960s, has promoted the socio-economic development of Zambia by undertaking research, training, education, publication and consultancy in the field of economics and related disciplines.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">In its role of political advisor, the EAZ takes advantage of public economic data to conduct policy research. Complementary to its own primary data collection, EAZ sources open data mainly from the Zambian Central statistical office and the Central Bank of Zambia. The type of data being used covers a wide range - economic and health indicators, population and economic census, health demographic surveys, and others. For example, in its website, which also serves as an advocacy platform, the EAZ has contributed to the dissemination of the results of 2015 Living Conditions Monitoring Survey, a poverty assessment <a href="http://eaz.org.zm/2015-living-conditions-monitoring-survey-results/" target="_blank">study </a>conducted by the Central statistical office to monitor and highlight the living conditions of the population of Zambia. In this way, the EAZ seeks to help the Government of Zambia achieve its objectives towards poverty reduction and strengthening the linkages between budgeting and planning.</p>

            <p class="expand-use-case-para">Mainly, the work of Odekro is to extract the data from different public sources, such as the Parliament of Ghana, the Electoral commission, and Ghana statistical service. While some of the data is available in excel formats, often Odekro has to convert data from paper or PDF to a machine-readable format. Making this information open allows media organizations to contribute to a more evidence-based public discussion, and increased public accountability of Members of Parliament. An example of this was the attention recently drawn to the country’s non-attending MPs after a <a href="https://www.modernghana.com/news/660880/1/125-mps-risk-losing-seats-for-absenteeism.html" target="_blank">letter sent by Odekro to the Speaker of Parliament based on this data</a>. The Odekro platform also provides tools that allow users to discuss online while discussions are taking place in the Parliament, as well as to report issues affecting their constituencies, or follow the specific issues the MPs for their constituencies are contributing to. In this way, Odekro aims to enable communities and marginalized populations to leverage this information to engage with government agencies.</p>

            <p class="expand-use-case-para"><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;Open government data provides Sagaci Research with a valuable resource for undertaking research endeavors. Sagaci Research provides market research and intelligence dedicated to african markets on a number of industries. Its reports, databases and field research (quantitative/qualitative) provide an up-to-date in-depth understanding of the key sectors in the region (consumer goods, retail, telecommunications, financial services, construction and real-estate, and others).</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">In particular, census data is crucial for the process of sampling when collecting research data from different areas of the country. Other types of open government data are also used. For example, the report “Registered vehicles in Kenya and Nigeria”, which presents key facts and data on the automotive market in Kenya and Nigeria, providing a compelling overview of both markets by leveraging on national statistics, such as vehicle registrations.</p>

            <p class="expand-use-case-para"><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;Founded in 2009, Twaweza is a civil society organization that helps citizens exercise agency and governments be more open and responsive in Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda. Twaweza works to provide practical information to everyone, to foster quality independent media and citizen monitoring services. Via its Uwazi unit, Twaweza produces policy briefs on key issues, thus triggering public debate and fostering an ecosystem of change. In this context, Twaweza is an active promoter of open data, encouraging both the supply and use of public data.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">In its own use, Twaweza draws on public data to conduct research across the fields of open government and basic education. For example, in the Tanzanian general elections in 2015, Twaweza organised televised debates between leading politicians from different parties, and used data from a range of different sources as a means of stimulating discussion, and of trying to guide the debate towards a greater focus on evidence. In part, the data that was used was sourced internally - from the Uwezo survey of basic learning outcomes and the Sautiza Wananchi mobile phone panel survey - but the remaining data, which included economic data, census and other household survey data, official data on public services (school enrolment rates, etc.) budget data and more, was pulled from official government sources. While some of the data was available in machine-readable formats, much had to be converted from pdfs and reports.</p>

            <p class="expand-use-case-para">The company built this dashboard from scratch using a combination of the Ministry of Health’s health facility registry dataset as well as its own crowd-based datasets. The dashboard provides health experts with monthly reports and weekly updates on health centers’ stocks data, such as initial stocks, quantity received, and quantity used during program implementation, as well as analysis on when each submission was received. Through Yeleman’s collection and analysis of continuously gathered health data, has been able to expand the program to the entire region of Mopti, and WHO Mali is considering implementing a similar system for other regions of Mali.</p>

            <p class="expand-use-case-para">Farmerline addresses both these issues, providing local farmers access to accurate, up-to-date weather forecasts and market prices.

            <p class="expand-use-case-para">Open government data is at the heart of this effort. Launched in 2013, Farmerline gathers open data on weather and market prices, and then repackages the information into outbound text and voice SMS messages, <a target="_blank" href="http://farmerline.co/2045-2/">servicing over 5000 farmers</a> in Ghana and available in nine different local languages. Fully incorporating voice messages in its service, Farmerline has expanded to farmers in rural areas, where <a href="http://www.statsghana.gov.gh/docfiles/glss5_report.pdf" target="_blank">literacy rates remain under 50%.</a>

Under the services of <a href="http://farmobi-technologies-pvt-ltd.android.informer.com/" target="_blank">Farmobi Technologies Pvt Ltd,</a> Mandi Trades allows buyers and sellers to bypass the middlemen often involved in the Indian food industry. Instead, this platform creates an environment where buyers can purchase crops directly from local farmers, which reduces transportation costs and increases profit margins for both parties. These services also automatically incorporate the locations of sellers upon uploading datasets.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">The Farmobi Technologies' app levels the agricultural market in two ways. First, it features agricultural market price data from the government of India’s data portal, <a target="_blank" href="https://data.gov.in/">data.gov.in</a>, to make public information access a key component to competitive pricing. Second, the app lets farmers directly post details about their crops, making purchasing decisions transparent to both suppliers and buyers. These two features in Mandi Trades not only decreases information asymmetry but also leverages existing government data to encourage public data use within the agriculture sector for fair and competitive pricing.</p>

Since the 1960s, the Economics Association of Zambia (EAZ), a non-partisan body established in the 1960s, has promoted the socio-economic development of Zambia by undertaking research, training, education, publication and consultancy in the field of economics and related disciplines.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">In its role of political advisor, the EAZ takes advantage of public economic data to conduct policy research. Complementary to its own primary data collection, EAZ sources open data mainly from the Zambian Central statistical office and the Central Bank of Zambia. The type of data being used covers a wide range - economic and health indicators, population and economic census, health demographic surveys, and others. For example, in its website, which also serves as an advocacy platform, the EAZ has contributed to the dissemination of the results of 2015 Living Conditions Monitoring Survey, a poverty assessment <a href="http://eaz.org.zm/2015-living-conditions-monitoring-survey-results/" target="_blank">study </a>conducted by the Central statistical office to monitor and highlight the living conditions of the population of Zambia. In this way, the EAZ seeks to help the Government of Zambia achieve its objectives towards poverty reduction and strengthening the linkages between budgeting and planning.</p>

To strengthen existing government data, NZIER incorporates information from The Treasury, New Zealand’s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/snapshots-of-nz/digital-yearbook-collection.aspx">Official Yearbooks (1893-2012)</a> from Statistics New Zealand, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oecd.org/gov/government-at-a-glance-2015-database.htm">Government at a Glance database</a> from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">These sources then develop their database called <a target="_blank" href="https://data1850.nz/">Data1850, </a>which bridges data from five sectors: government, economic activity, prices, international linkages, and people. With the lack of statistics data available prior to 1850, the platform was coined Data1850. Their services include datasets or other information on economic or statistics based history, spanning from 1850 to present day. Easily operable and downloadable, the data is available for free on the website. Users choose among economic activity, people, and prices to begin, and then narrow down data options. For example, employment may be first narrowed down by industry or by occupation, then the types of services or professions.</p>

Sagaci Research provides market research and intelligence dedicated to african markets on a number of industries. Its reports, databases and field research (quantitative/qualitative) provide an up-to-date in-depth understanding of the key sectors in the region (consumer goods, retail, telecommunications, financial services, construction and real-estate, and others).</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">In particular, census data is crucial for the process of sampling when collecting research data from different areas of the country. Other types of open government data are also used. For example, the report “Registered vehicles in Kenya and Nigeria”, which presents key facts and data on the automotive market in Kenya and Nigeria, providing a compelling overview of both markets by leveraging on national statistics, such as vehicle registrations.</p>

In the realm of evolving intellectual property rights and the continual stream of new innovations, individuals and companies face the challenge of tracking legal developments. This platform facilitates easy information access by consolidating information from government patent websites. Databases and their contents are openly accessible and downloadable from this platform, including United States and European patents and applications, Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) documents, and Japanese abstracts.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">An open platform for data storage and accessible usage such as SumoBrain expedites the patent search process for lawyers, investors, and researchers. While maintaining transparency, these efforts encourage greater competition and access to industry trends through government-based mechanisms, taking what already exists and interpreting the data for public use. Ultimately, the opportunity to build products off of open data lowers barriers for many entering or participating in an industry. For example, by placing government publications into one database, SumoBrain provides users around the world have immediate access to patent documents and references, all of which presented in a consistent and searchable format. Users maintain virtual tools to manage work files through annotations, exports to Excel, and editing access for colleagues.</p>

GoodGuide works to provide consumers with this kind of information through its searchable consumer product database, ranking products such as candy, coffee and tea, food, and household chemicals, by their health, environment, and social performances.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">GoodGuide draws its information from a wide variety of sources, from scientific institutions to NGOs to open government data sources. Its algorithm takes these datasets and ranks products correspondingly. For example, if a user were to look up Teas, they would find Frontier’s and Twinings’ Green Teas, as well as 4,831 other tea products, all ranked with an aggregate GoodGuide score as well as company, environment, and social scores. These scores are associated with indicators such as the amount of recycled content in their packaging for their environmental score, or whether a product is certified fair trade for its social score.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">GoodGuide improves the ability for consumers to not only learn what they are buying in terms of work conditions and company environmental and social efforts, but also to gain a level of collective purchasing power based on increased information symmetry.</p>

In a population where <a target="_blank" href="http://www.state.gov/p/wha/rt/soa/2015/stories/239823.htm">69% lack access to computers or the Internet,</a> such communities have a wide array of educational and technological needs. The Government of Mexico worked jointly with ENOVA to achieve digital inclusivity in establishing a “Network of Innovation and Learning” (Las redes de innovación y aprendizaje - RIA) centers. ENOVA utilized open data to determine areas of greatest need and most potential impact.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">Through a method characterized as <a target="_blank" href="http://enova.mx/en/node/297">“urban acupuncture”</a>, several indicators taken from publicly accessible databases were examined, including population density, income, level of education, public schools, commercial areas, public transportation systems, green areas, and access to roads. With 70 centers across 34 municipalities in the State of Mexico, government data was maximized to assess local needs within educational capacity building. Since each institution has specific needs, Enova focuses on the importance of adaptability in addition to the accessibility of their products.</p>

Green Patrol leads investigations using citizen-based self-reporting systems, regional data from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, regional open data portals, and Green Patrol investigations. Through a <a href="http://greenpatrol.ru/sites/default/files/broshyura_english_prezent.pdf" target="_blank">network of 53 branches </a>throughout Russia, they collect data and integrate findings on environmental governance issues onto the online database. Green Patrol has investigations completed on 85 regions in Russia.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">To support these investigations, Green Patrol uses geographic information system (GIS) to create accurate environmental rankings of the entities within Russia. These rankings rely on indicators such as water, land resources, bioresources and more, along with environmental indexes. In order to use this data, Green Patrol seeks information from regional data portals and Russian Ministries; they include mortality data, environmental protection expenditures, and air polluters and surface water bodies. Through these mediums, Green Patrol created for the Sakha Republic, for example, a <a target="_blank" href="http://greenpatrol.ru/sites/default/files/doklad_o_sostoyanii_i_ohrane_okruzhayushchey_sredy_respubliki_saha_2014_god.pdf">2014 regional report</a> and <a href="http://greenpatrol.ru/ru/regiony/respublika-saha-yakutiya" target="_blank">up-to-date assessments</a> to evaluate environmental policy violations.

            <p class="expand-use-case-para"><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;The idea for Päästöt.fi came about when its creator ran into a roadblock while looking into greenhouse gas emissions statistics of a local energy company. In order to circumvent this issue, he came across the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) database, which was established in July 2000 to collect the annual emissions numbers from industrial facilities across Europe. Päästöt.fi emerged was created in 2010 to allow users to compare emission levels from industrial facilities across Europe.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">Päästöt.fi visualizes some 30,000 industrial facilities, from mining sites to coal-fired plants. These facilities are all mapped on the platform, and information such as CO2, heavy metal, or another 89 other kinds of industrial emissions are overlaid on this map; the magnitude of each site’s emissions is shown through circles of varying sizes, and a box to the right relates the numerical figures associated with the selected site.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">Päästöt.fi manages to effectively communicate important information that was previously stored within a huge dataset that a layperson would otherwise not engage with. Through its visualization, citizens are now able to gain the necessary information to lobby and create change.</p>

            <p class="expand-use-case-para">For example, Thinknum allows users to view the store locations of a given brand, overlay it with locations of a competitor, and then connect this information to demographic data such as median household income by county. This information can then be used to inform an organization’s strategy of where household income is increasing, and thereby identify the most profitable store locations. Other examples include the analysis of unemployment rates to discover outperforming businesses in the restaurant industry, and taking advantage of historical weather data to find market patterns. By creating connections between different data sources, Thinknum allows investors and companies to better understand the various factors that drive valuation.</p>

            <p class="expand-use-case-para"><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;Ghana’s legislature is composed of 275 Members of Parliament (MPs) that are elected to serve their single-member constituencies. However, while the majority of the activities in parliament, such as votings, motions, and committees, take place in the open, too often, information is difficult to find, access and use. Created in 2012, Odekro is an online platform that aims to promote transparency and citizen participation in Ghana by providing public access to Bills, Motions, and Parliamentary proceedings (Hansards).</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">Mainly, the work of Odekro is to extract the data from different public sources, such as the Parliament of Ghana, the Electoral commission, and Ghana statistical service. While some of the data is available in excel formats, often Odekro has to convert data from paper or PDF to a machine-readable format. Making this information open allows media organizations to contribute to a more evidence-based public discussion, and increased public accountability of Members of Parliament. An example of this was the attention recently drawn to the country’s non-attending MPs after a <a href="https://www.modernghana.com/news/660880/1/125-mps-risk-losing-seats-for-absenteeism.html" target="_blank">letter sent by Odekro to the Speaker of Parliament based on this data</a>. The Odekro platform also provides tools that allow users to discuss online while discussions are taking place in the Parliament, as well as to report issues affecting their constituencies, or follow the specific issues the MPs for their constituencies are contributing to. In this way, Odekro aims to enable communities and marginalized populations to leverage this information to engage with government agencies.</p>

It revealed that 85% of the 3365 incidents took place in eight specific states: Bihar, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Within the remaining states, seven failed to report a single incident of communal violence. Publishing this article enhanced a dialogue on the subject of law and order within state governments, shedding light on systemic issues.</p>

            <p class="expand-use-case-para"><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;La Nacion newspaper has been engaged in using and disseminating open data in various ways. In 2010, the newspaper started a project on data visualization where journalists, graphic designers and computer scientists worked together to understand how visualization tools can be used for reporting. The first delivery of this initiative, a <a href="http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1380725-colectivos-insaciables-un-cheque-diario-de-10-millones-en-subsidios" target="_blank">report </a>on Argentina’s Subsidies System for Transportation, relied on combining open transportation data from two government agencies ( Secretary of Transportation, and National Commission for Transport Regulation). The investigation discovered that the subsidies (gas and cash) grew dramatically (up to $34 billion) during the past ten years, and revealed the 20 companies that received more money from this system.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">However, getting the public data in the first place poses a significant challenge. Since Argentina doesn’t have a law that allows citizens access public documents, like Freedom of Information Act in the U.S, all the information used in this investigation had to be converted from PDF’s documents to CSV and Excel files. In this context, making public data available in an open format is another goal of La Nacion. In march 2012, the newspaper launched an <a target="_blank" href="http://data.lanacion.com.ar/dashboards/4608/actividad-legislativa/">open data portal</a>. In this portal, users can access official data in the domains of legislation and policy-making, general indicators, environment, sports, and economics.</p>

In the last few years, Telefónica has been an active promoter of open data use, both internally and externally. In its own operations, Telefónica makes use of open economic data, as well as demographic data, to identify customer segments and adjust product offerings in accordance with economic forecast. The organization also leverages satellite and population data to inform decisions on where to build telecommunications infrastructure.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">Telefónica engages a broad stakeholder network as well around open data use. For example, in 2013, in partnership with the Open Data Institute and the MIT Medialab, Telefónica hosted a <a target="_blank" href="http://dynamicinsights.telefonica.com/2013/08/29/using-big-data-for-social-good/">“hackathon for big data”</a> which promoted the integration of open transportation and health data with other proprietary data sets. to create value for social good. During the event, teams were encouraged to study how crowds move towards high streets during the busy Christmas shopping period in order to develop strategies for the emergency services to allocate their resources more effectively, or make recommendations of how to manage the flow of road traffic on London’s busiest routes. In its home country, Telefónica has also promoted the use of open data by hosting workshops on <a href="https://en.fundaciontelefonica.com/blog/conferencias/data-journalism-and-open-data/" target="_blank">“Data Journalism and Open Data”</a> to &nbsp;encourage Spanish journalists, programmers and other professionals to create content using open data.</p>

Twaweza works to provide practical information to everyone, to foster quality independent media and citizen monitoring services. Via its Uwazi unit, Twaweza produces policy briefs on key issues, thus triggering public debate and fostering an ecosystem of change. In this context, Twaweza is an active promoter of open data, encouraging both the supply and use of public data.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">In its own use, Twaweza draws on public data to conduct research across the fields of open government and basic education. For example, in the Tanzanian general elections in 2015, Twaweza organised televised debates between leading politicians from different parties, and used data from a range of different sources as a means of stimulating discussion, and of trying to guide the debate towards a greater focus on evidence. In part, the data that was used was sourced internally - from the Uwezo survey of basic learning outcomes and the Sautiza Wananchi mobile phone panel survey - but the remaining data, which included economic data, census and other household survey data, official data on public services (school enrolment rates, etc.) budget data and more, was pulled from official government sources. While some of the data was available in machine-readable formats, much had to be converted from pdfs and reports.</p>

Accordingly, information on a vehicle’s history is therefore seen as an essential help for shoppers to make better purchase decisions when buying cars. InstaVIN addresses this by providing a vehicle history reporting service that looks up information on a Vehicle identification number (VIN) instantly when it is submitted by a consumer, and then sends the information back to the consumer.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">The service runs an immediate background check on the vehicle, grabbing information from state and federal government sources, like the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System, police reports, as well as from private sources like car dealers and insurance records. This information, which may include theft, towing, impound, lien data, vehicle specifications, is then sent right back to the consumer. Taking advantage of this combination of data sources, consumers can get the title and salvage history of a vehicle thus reducing the risk of making a costly decision when purchasing it.</p>

Under the services of <a href="http://farmobi-technologies-pvt-ltd.android.informer.com/" target="_blank">Farmobi Technologies Pvt Ltd,</a> Mandi Trades allows buyers and sellers to bypass the middlemen often involved in the Indian food industry. Instead, this platform creates an environment where buyers can purchase crops directly from local farmers, which reduces transportation costs and increases profit margins for both parties. These services also automatically incorporate the locations of sellers upon uploading datasets.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">The Farmobi Technologies' app levels the agricultural market in two ways. First, it features agricultural market price data from the government of India’s data portal, <a target="_blank" href="https://data.gov.in/">data.gov.in</a>, to make public information access a key component to competitive pricing. Second, the app lets farmers directly post details about their crops, making purchasing decisions transparent to both suppliers and buyers. These two features in Mandi Trades not only decreases information asymmetry but also leverages existing government data to encourage public data use within the agriculture sector for fair and competitive pricing.</p>

            <p class="expand-use-case-para"><strong>Data Used:</strong>&nbsp;Economic indicators, health indicators, household surveys, living conditions survey, demographic survey, economic census, population census, agriculture census from Zambia’s Central statistical office (CSO) and the Central Bank of Zambia</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para"><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;While Zambia’s economy has continued to grow at an average annual rate in recent years, global headwinds and domestic pressures have strained the Zambian economy. Since the 1960s, the Economics Association of Zambia (EAZ), a non-partisan body established in the 1960s, has promoted the socio-economic development of Zambia by undertaking research, training, education, publication and consultancy in the field of economics and related disciplines.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">In its role of political advisor, the EAZ takes advantage of public economic data to conduct policy research. Complementary to its own primary data collection, EAZ sources open data mainly from the Zambian Central statistical office and the Central Bank of Zambia. The type of data being used covers a wide range - economic and health indicators, population and economic census, health demographic surveys, and others. For example, in its website, which also serves as an advocacy platform, the EAZ has contributed to the dissemination of the results of 2015 Living Conditions Monitoring Survey, a poverty assessment <a href="http://eaz.org.zm/2015-living-conditions-monitoring-survey-results/" target="_blank">study </a>conducted by the Central statistical office to monitor and highlight the living conditions of the population of Zambia. In this way, the EAZ seeks to help the Government of Zambia achieve its objectives towards poverty reduction and strengthening the linkages between budgeting and planning.</p>

            <p class="expand-use-case-para">Katadata makes extensive use of open data while combining journalism and analysis, i.e. news and research, in its day-to-day business. In this context, Katadata created Databoks, a data portal that hosts business and economic statistical data from Indonesia. Considering the fragmentation of Indonesian economics and business data, Databoks was created with the goal of facilitating the use of data by companies, business people, researchers, students, government and media for various purposes, such as presentations, report creation and strengthening of media coverage.</p>

            </p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">The Budget Calendar project is a grid including the time of the year on the y axis and the steps towards approving a budget on the x axis. Within each cell, Expert Grup links the user to government reports relevant to that specific piece of the budget process, streamlining what could be a tedious search through multiple government sites to find this information. Expert Grup’s OpenSpending budget treemap also uses this open data, compiling it into a colorful visualization that gives the viewer a comparative understanding on where Moldova fits in comparison to other countries’ parliaments.</p>

            <p class="expand-use-case-para"><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;Ghana’s legislature is composed of 275 Members of Parliament (MPs) that are elected to serve their single-member constituencies. However, while the majority of the activities in parliament, such as votings, motions, and committees, take place in the open, too often, information is difficult to find, access and use. Created in 2012, Odekro is an online platform that aims to promote transparency and citizen participation in Ghana by providing public access to Bills, Motions, and Parliamentary proceedings (Hansards).</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">Mainly, the work of Odekro is to extract the data from different public sources, such as the Parliament of Ghana, the Electoral commission, and Ghana statistical service. While some of the data is available in excel formats, often Odekro has to convert data from paper or PDF to a machine-readable format. Making this information open allows media organizations to contribute to a more evidence-based public discussion, and increased public accountability of Members of Parliament. An example of this was the attention recently drawn to the country’s non-attending MPs after a <a href="https://www.modernghana.com/news/660880/1/125-mps-risk-losing-seats-for-absenteeism.html" target="_blank">letter sent by Odekro to the Speaker of Parliament based on this data</a>. The Odekro platform also provides tools that allow users to discuss online while discussions are taking place in the Parliament, as well as to report issues affecting their constituencies, or follow the specific issues the MPs for their constituencies are contributing to. In this way, Odekro aims to enable communities and marginalized populations to leverage this information to engage with government agencies.</p>

Through Yeleman’s collection and analysis of continuously gathered health data, has been able to expand the program to the entire region of Mopti, and WHO Mali is considering implementing a similar system for other regions of Mali.</p>

            <p class="expand-use-case-para"><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;Founded in 2009, Twaweza is a civil society organization that helps citizens exercise agency and governments be more open and responsive in Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda. Twaweza works to provide practical information to everyone, to foster quality independent media and citizen monitoring services. Via its Uwazi unit, Twaweza produces policy briefs on key issues, thus triggering public debate and fostering an ecosystem of change. In this context, Twaweza is an active promoter of open data, encouraging both the supply and use of public data.</p>
            <p class="expand-use-case-para">In its own use, Twaweza draws on public data to conduct research across the fields of open government and basic education. For example, in the Tanzanian general elections in 2015, Twaweza organised televised debates between leading politicians from different parties, and used data from a range of different sources as a means of stimulating discussion, and of trying to guide the debate towards a greater focus on evidence. In part, the data that was used was sourced internally - from the Uwezo survey of basic learning outcomes and the Sautiza Wananchi mobile phone panel survey - but the remaining data, which included economic data, census and other household survey data, official data on public services (school enrolment rates, etc.) budget data and more, was pulled from official government sources. While some of the data was available in machine-readable formats, much had to be converted from pdfs and reports.</p>
